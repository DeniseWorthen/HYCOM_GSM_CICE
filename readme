**********************************************************************
compiling code and running the coupled model:
**********************************************************************
1. Your login shell needs to be either tcsh or csh.
2. Please add the following lines to your .cshrc file in your home directory:

limit stacksize unlimited
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/scratch4/NCEPDEV/nems/noscrub/emc.nemspara/soft/esmf/7.1.0bs30/lib

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Assume that your working directory is called work.

a) Getting the code:
svn co https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nems/apps/HYCOM-GSM-CICE/trunk work

b) Compiling the code:
method 1:
cd work
./NEMS/NEMSAppBuilder
select <YES> when the third window (called Build enveironment) appears.
cp NEMS/exe/NEMS.x run_dir/NEMS/exe

method 2:
cd work
load all modules shown in file "modulefiles/theia/ESMF_710_gsm".
./NEMS/NEMSAppBuilder
select <NO> when the third window (called Build enveironment) appears.
cp NEMS/exe/NEMS.x run_dir/NEMS/exe

------------------------------------------------------------
c) Running the model:
cd work/run_dir/NEMS/compsets
If your ACCNR (your account number) is not "marine-cpu", edit the compsets to set your ACCNR.
cd ../..
Specify the compset that you want to run in "HYCOM-GSM-CICE.compsetRun".
./NEMS/NEMSCompsetRun

The model output directory is located at /scratch3/NCEPDEV/stmp1/Your_first_name.Your_last_name.


ESMF Tracing
------------------------------------------------------------
To activate ESMF tracing for timing the application, edit the file:
run_dir/NEMS/tests/exglobal_fcst_nems.sh

and uncomment the lines:
#export ESMF_RUNTIME_TRACE=ON                                                                                                
#export ESMF_RUNTIME_TRACE_PETLIST="0 144 168"   

The ESMF_RUNTIME_TRACE_PETLIST environment variable should be
set to the set of PETs to trace.  It is recommended to only trace
the root PET of each component (to reduce size of trace).

The trace will appear in the "traceout" directory of the run
directory.  Information about analyzing the trace is available at:
http://cupid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runtime.html
